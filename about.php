			When husband-and-wife team Carley Roney and David Liu cofounded The Knot, they had one mission in mind – to help other couples easily navigate every wedding planning detail, both big and small. After all, they've learned these lessons the hard way planning their own wedding (hint: make sure the AC works if you’re getting married on a rooftop in July!). Combine a whirlwind engagement, an unfamiliar city and an interracial couple and forget it – there was simply no resource with the insight they needed to help them plan. 

Even though their wedding was a blast, Carley and David realized better resources would have made planning their nuptials a lot less stressful. So they vowed to make wedding planning easy and fun for everyone else. For nearly 20 years we’ve helped millions of couples plan amazing, memorable weddings. You’re next!
